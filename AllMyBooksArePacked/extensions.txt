1. Domains beyond Amazon.com
	Ans: The application can get html from new domains using the request module. Also it can get the html of html files in a local folder when you specify the folder's path. All that functionality is contained within the html.js module. 

2. Products beyond just simply books.
	Ans: The application has an amazonBook module which is specifically designed to parse book data from amazon pages. It uses a book module to get a book constructor. So if we decided to parse through Craigslist looking for cars, we would have to add an additional module that does the parsing(called craigslistCars) and specify the data we want to get from it in another constructor module(called car). 

3. Parse and ship 2,000,000 books (in a reasonably time frame; e.g., polynomial time) instead of merely 20.
 	Ans: The first fit heuristic algorithm used in the programming exercise would parse and ship 2 million books in polynomial time(O(n^2)). It's efficiency increases when the input array is nonincreasing. The logic for the algorithm is contained within the nextfit module. However, the algorithm can be further improved to run in O(nlogn) time. The improved algorithm would really help speed up parsing on such large inputs. The better algorithm can be created using binary trees.
